# docker_project
THis is my Simple Web form created using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JS. And I am running my Web form on Docker. So this project includes Dockerfile as well as docker-compose.yml file required to set up docker environment the src folder consists of Web forms.
In the browser use the url localhost:8080 if you are see Welcome page then Docker is running successfully.
