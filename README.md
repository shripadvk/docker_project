# docker_project
This is my Simple Web form created using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JS. And I am running my Web form on Docker. So this project includes Dockerfile as well as docker-compose.yml file required to set up docker environment the src folder consists of Web forms.
Now run docker-compose up command in current folder.
